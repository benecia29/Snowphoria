            <h2 style="color: #3E54AC;">HISTORY OF METEOROLOGICAL SERVICES IN INDIA</h2><br>
            <p style="color: #8294C4; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                The beginnings of meteorology in India can be traced to ancient times.
                Early philosophical writings of the 3000 B.C. era, such as the Upanishadas,
                contain serious discussion about the processes of cloud formation and rain and the
                seasonal cycles caused by the movement of earth round the sun. Varahamihira's
                classical work, the Brihatsamhita, written around 500 A.D., provides a clear
                evidence that a deep knowledge of atmospheric processes existed even in those times.
                It was understood that rains come from the sun (Adityat Jayate Vrishti) and that good
                rainfall in the rainy season was the key to bountiful agriculture and food for the people.
                Kautilya's Arthashastra contains records of scientific measurements of rainfall and its
                application to the country's revenue and relief work. Kalidasa in his epic, 'Meghdoot',
                written around the seventh century, even mentions the date of onset of the monsoon over
                central India and traces the path of the monsoon clouds.</p>
            <p style="color: #8294C4; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                Meteorology, as we perceive it now, may be said to have had its firm scientific
                foundation in the 17th century after the invention of the thermometer and the
                barometer and the formulation of laws governing the behaviour of atmospheric gases.
                It was in 1636 that Halley, a British scientist, published his treatise on the Indian
                summer monsoon, which he attributed to a seasonal reversal of winds due to the
                differential heating of the Asian land mass and the Indian Ocean.</p>
            <p style="color: #8294C4; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                India is fortunate to have some of the oldest meteorological observatories
                of the world. The British East India Company established several such
                stations, for example, those at Calcutta in 1785 and Madras (now Chennai)
                in 1796 for studying the weather and climate of India. The Asiatic Society
                of Bengal founded in 1784 at Calcutta, and in 1804 at Bombay (now Mumbai),
                promoted scientific studies in meteorology in India. Captain Harry Piddington
                at Calcutta published 40 papers during 1835-1855 in the Journal of the Asiatic
                Society dealing with tropical storms and coined the word "cyclone", meaning the
                coil of a snake. In 1842 he published his monumental work on the "Laws of the
                Storms". In the first half of the 19th century, several observatories began
                functioning in India under the provincial governments.</p>
            <p style="color: #8294C4; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 60px;">
                A disastrous tropical cyclone struck Calcutta in 1864 and this was followed
                by failures of the monsoon rains in 1866 and 1871. In the year 1875, the
                Government of India established the India Meteorological Department, bringing
                all meteorological work in the country under a central authority. Mr. H. F.
                Blanford was appointed Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India.
                The first Director General of Observatories was Sir John Eliot who was appointed
                in May 1889 at Calcutta headquarters. The headquarters of IMD were later shifted
                to Shimla, then to Poona (now Pune) and finally to New Delhi.
